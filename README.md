Python Script to automatically update Windows Task Actions


I currently have a task that runs Discord with admin rights at user login. I ran into an issue where whenever Discord was updated, the path to the executable changes.
So to help solve this problem, I created this python script to edit the existing task's action whenever the path was updated. In theory, this could be applied to other applications/use cases.
